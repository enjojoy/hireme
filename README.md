I'm a Web3-focused Software Developer with 3+ years experience in web development, specializing in TypeScript, React, and Next.js. 

Aside from coding and participating in hackathons, I love organizing events, participating in pop-up cities (MegaZu, Builder Monastery), reading books, tweeting and participating in educational programs such as [Kernel](https://www.kernel.community/). 

Right now I'm learning smart contracts development with Foundry. 

I don‚Äôt hesitate to take responsibility for tasks that I have never done before, I enjoy learning by doing and I constantly push myself to grow and expand my skill set beyond my comfort zone.

I'm based in Prague, Czech Republic and open for relocation or remote work. 

## Employment

### **[Trezor](https://trezor.io/trezor-suite)** | August 2024 - March 2025
Contributed to crypto assets management features such as send, swap and others in Trezor Suite - web and desktop application.

- Improved UI/UX by bringing more details for transparency and validation for security into user interactions with the interface, including: 
  - Warning the user when they're trying to send to a smart contract address.
  - Converting the address to its checksummed version when it's appropriate.
  - Displaying the exact amount of fees needed to proceed with a token transaction. 
  - Detailed overview of a multitoken (ERC-1155 type) transaction.
  - Advanced logic for bumping fee in case of multiple transactions pending, so that the user doesn't have to decide which transaction to bump first.
  - Added pages with account details, so that the user can learn about type (legacy, segwit etc.), derivation path and other details about their account, as well as displaying account type badges throughout the app, for the non-default account types, for example, if the account is migrated from Ledger
  - Re-made the part of send form responsible for choosing a token, introducing more user-friendly, transparent and informative UI.
